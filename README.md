## 🚀 About Me

I am a systems engineer focused on building reliable, scalable, secure full stack solutions using modern enterprise architectures. My approach is driven by clean design principles, long-term maintainability, and production-readiness.

I don’t build “projects”.  
I design **systems** that survive long-term business growth.
